# Img-to-pdf-Converter
A simple Python app to convert multiple images into a single PDF. Created to help students like me organize lecture photos efficiently, instead of scrolling through a gallery. Select images, name your PDF, and convert! Built with Tkinter for the GUI, ReportLab for PDFs, and Pillow for image handling.
